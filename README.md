# Math-Challenge-Python-Project

In this mini python project. I created an easy Timed Math Challenge as a python program. I only used the +, - and * operators here. This simple program won't work too well with division, I would need a separate set of parameters. The purpose of this mini project is to showcase that I have the basic skills or foundation to understand and work with Python.

This is not taught in the program that I'm currently enrolled at Seneca but I'm learning this on the side when I have the time.
